# Metagenome-wide-association-study-MWAS-
This repository has codes, data summaries, and supplementary files for manuscript on metagenome-wide association study(WMAS) of bovine microbiome. We utilized rumen microbiota gene abundance to perform MWAS using Bayesian ridge regression in BGLR and then perform quantifying microbial gene marker effects by Microbiability and forward stepwise reg.
